I'm a Research Engineer at [Reface](https://reface.ai/), where I work on [BitePal](https://bitepal.app/) — an AI calorie tracker app. I build core features end to end, focusing on multimodal alignment, synthetic data generation, and optimal technical solutions to support business requests.

I'm also a Research Fellow (RAI for Ukraine program) at the [Center for Responsible AI](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/centers/center-responsible-ai) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), working on RL policy reusability under the supervision of [Sihem Amer-Yahia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rMtUkMcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Noha Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bmAiTSEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for one year focused on service solutions for new client engagements. Highlights include multi-agent applications with an RLHF loop, tool usage, RAG, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting, image generation, and improvements to a multi-speaker diarization system.

Research
======
My research interests sit at the intersection of multimodal AI and efficient reasoning. I’m especially interested in vision-language models, their extension toward vision-language-action systems, and the role of vision foundation models in building robust, grounded capabilities. I’m also interested in the use of small language models for agentic tasks.

Honors, Awards
======
- Awarded 3rd Place in the First Round of the All-Ukrainian Student Research Competition in Fields of Knowledge and Specialties for the 2024/2025 academic year for my bachelor’s thesis work (see [certificate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihor-vitenko-202458264/overlay/1745861696014/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAEDZvCIBIDiP7tRMHV76LfIYcZWQYxrxTSQ)).

Personal
======
- Sports are an inseparable part of my life: I train kickboxing, previously ran a half marathon, and rode 140 km in one day by bicycle through cities in Kyiv Oblast that suffered during the [Battle of Kyiv (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022)).
- I enjoy billiards (pool) and can happily spend hours practicing it.
- I'm a huge Star Wars fan.
